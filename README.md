# HTFBot ♍️
Repository used for collecting random cogs from Discord Red and reusing them into a private Discord bot.

This bot is mostly used in the [Happy Tree Friends Discord server](https://discord.gg/qj67XZvAFc).

Made with [Red Discord Bot](https://discord.red).
# DO NOT USE THIS REPO
This repo is meant for a private Discord bot instance, and we do not recommend using this as this uses cogs that does not belong to us. Some cogs here are made for the bot itself, but it's mostly exclusive to the HTF Discord server and will not work properly in other servers/won't work at all.
